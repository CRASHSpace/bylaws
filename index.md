<H2>Welcome to The CRASH Space Bylaws Repo</H2>

<p>We are a big believer in open governance, and we are a hackerspace, so what better way to manage our docs than in version control. </p>

<h3>How To Navigate</h3>

<p>They links to each article can be found on the "Articles" link in the navigation bar above.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Carlyn Maw headed the original push for these bylaws back in 2011. They are very tightly based off of Noisebridge's.  After working sessions that included  Sean Bonner,  Steve Goldstein, Tod Kurt, Matt Pinner, Levi Simmons, Theron Trowbridge and others, she worked heavily with Tom Wrobel of the non-profit legal center to make sure they said what we wanted them to say before we submitted them to the IRS with our 1023 form. </p>
