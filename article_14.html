Article 14. Inspection Rights

14.1. Members' Right to Inspect
14.1.1 Membership Records
Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any
member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to
the member's interest as a member:
(1) Inspect and copy the records containing members' names, addresses, and
voting rights during usual business hours on five days' prior written demand
on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection
rights are requested; or
(2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, on written demand and
tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of
members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record
date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of
demand, specified by the member. The demand shall state the purpose for
which the list is requested. The secretary shall make this list available to the
member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the
date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be
compiled.
The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this
Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely
achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing
access to or a copy of the membership list. Any rejection of this offer must be in
writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the
proper purpose of the demand.
If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a
purpose other than one reasonably related to a person's interest as a member, or if it
provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member
access to the membership list. Any inspection and copying under this Section may
be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. The right of inspection
includes the right to copy and make extracts. This right of inspection extends to the
records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
14.1.2 Accounting Records and Minutes
On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make
extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of
the members, the board of directors, and committees of the board at any reasonable
time for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member. Any
such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the
corporation.
14.1.3 Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws
This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy
of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which
shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office
hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on
the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.
This corporation shall keep a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as
amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection on the corporation's
website.
