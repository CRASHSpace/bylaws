We may move them to the pages format, but for now they are up! \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCarlyn Maw headed the original push for these bylaws back in 2011. They are very tightly based off of Noisebridge's.  After working sessions that included  Sean Bonner,  Steve Goldstein, Tod Kurt, Matt Pinner, Levi Simmons, Theron Trowbridge and others, she worked heavily with Tom Wrobel of the non-profit legal center to make sure they said what we wanted them to say before we submitted them to the IRS with our 1023 form. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have questions, please check out http://www.crashspace.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
