    Article 11. Indemnification
To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors,
officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a),
including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses,
judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," as that term is used in that section, and
including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the
person is or was a person described in that section. "Expenses," as used in this bylaw,
shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code. On written
request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code
section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations
Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board
shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because
the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which
indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not
parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that
meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether
the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the
meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.
To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in
a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under Article
11 of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be
advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the
corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be
repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation for those expenses.
