known as Voting Members.

any committee members or board members by majority vote at a two week special
noticed meeting. In addition, members shall have all rights afforded members under the
California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.
6.3. Other Persons Associated With Corporation
How to have "membership" levels that do not have voting privileges
This corporation may refer other persons or entities associated with it as "members," even
though those persons or entities are not voting members as set forth in this Article 6 of
these bylaws, but no such reference shall constitute anyone as a member within the
meaning of Corporations Code section 5056 unless that person or entity shall have
qualified for a voting membership under Section 6.1 of these bylaws. References in these
bylaws to "members" shall mean members as defined in Corporations Code section 5056;
i.e., the members of the class set forth in Section 6.1 of these bylaws. By amendment of
its articles of incorporation or of these bylaws, the corporation may grant some or all of the rights of a member of any class to any person or entity that does not have the right to

within 30 days after they are due and payable;
• (d) Any event that renders the member ineligible for membership, or failure to
satisfy membership qualifications; or
• (e) Termination of membership under Section 6.8 of these bylaws based on the
good faith determination by the board, or a committee or person authorized by the
board to make such a determination, that the member has failed in a material and
serious degree to observe the rules of conduct of the corporation, or has engaged
in conduct materially and seriously prejudicial to the corporation's purposes and
interests.
6.7. Suspension of Membership
A member may be suspended, under Section 6.8 of these bylaws, based on the good faith
determination by the board, or a committee or person authorized by the board to make

observe the corporation's rules of conduct, or has engaged in conduct materially and
seriously prejudicial to the corporation's purposes and interests. A person whose
membership is suspended shall not be a member during the period of suspension,
6.8. Termination or Suspension of Membership - Procedure

(d) Electing to wind up and dissolve the corporation.

personally or by first-class, registered, or certified mail, or by other means of
written communication, charges prepaid, and shall be addressed to each member
entitled to vote, at the address of that member as it appears on the books of the corporation or at the address given by the member to the corporation for purposes
of notice.
(a) Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation shall be valid only if

(2) To a recipient who has provided an unrevoked consent to the use of those
means of transmission for communications; and
(3) That creates a record that is capable of retention, retrieval, and review,
and that may thereafter be rendered into clearly legible tangible form.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(1) An electronic transmission by this corporation to a member is not
authorized unless, in addition to satisfying the requirements of this section,
the transmission satisfies the requirements applicable to consumer consent to
electronic record as set forth in the Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act (15 United States Code section 7001 (c)(1)).
(2) Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation
after either of the following: (i) the corporation is unable to deliver two
consecutive notices to the member by that means or (ii) the inability so to
deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any
assistant secretary, or any other person responsible for the giving of the
notice.
6.11.4 Affidavit of Mailing Notice

transaction of business at any meeting of members. If, however, the attendance at any
general or annual meeting, whether in person or by proxy, is less than one third of the

nature was given under Section 6.11 of these bylaws.
6.13. Voting
6.13.1 Eligibility to Vote
Subject to the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, all
members in good standing on the record date as determined under Section
6.15 of these bylaws shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of members.
Each member entitled to vote may cast one vote on each matter submitted to
a vote of the members. Members may not accumulate votes for the election
of directors.
6.13.2 Manner of Voting
Voting may be by voice or by ballot, except that any election of directors
must be by ballot if demanded before the voting begins by any member at the
meeting.
6.13.3 Number of Votes
Each member entitled to vote may cast one vote on each matter submitted to
a vote of the members.
6.13.4 Approval by Majority Vote
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
represented at the meeting, entitled to vote and voting on any matter, shall be
deemed the act of the members unless otherwise required by the California
Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law or by the articles of incorporation.
6.13.5 Waiver of Notice or Consent
The transactions of any meeting of members, however called or noticed and
wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after
standard call and notice, if (a) a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and (b) either before or after the meeting, each member entitled to
vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, a
consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the
meeting. The waiver of notice, consent, or approval need not specify either
the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting except that, if
action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any matter specified
in Section 6.11.b. of these bylaws, the waiver of notice, consent, or approval
shall state the general nature of the proposal. All such waivers, consents, or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. A member's attendance at a meeting shall also
constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting unless the
member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Also,
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the
consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting
but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
6.14. Actions Without Meetings / Action by unanimous written consent
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without
a meeting, if all members consent in writing to the action. The written consent or
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting. The action by written
consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the members.
6.15 Record Date
6.15.1 Record Date for Notice, Voting, and Other Board Actions
For purposes of establishing the members entitled to receive notice of any
meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting, or entitled to exercise any rights in
any lawful action, the board of directors may, in advance, fix a record date.
The record date so fixed for:
(1) sending notice of a meeting shall be no more than 90 nor less than
10 days before the date of the meeting;
(2) voting at a meeting shall be no more than 60 days before the date
of the meeting;
(3) taking any other action shall be no more than 60 days before that
action.
6.15.2 Record Date for Actions Not Set by BoardIf not otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members
entitled to receive notice of a meeting of members shall be the next business
day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, the
next business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If not
otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members
entitled to vote at the meeting shall be the day on which the meeting is held.
If not otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members
entitled to exercise any rights with respect to any other lawful action shall be
the date on which the board adopts the resolution relating to that action, or
the 60th day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
For purposes of this Section, a person holding a membership at the close of
business on the record date shall be a member of record.
6.16. Proxies
a. Members' Proxy Rights
Each member entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by
one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, signed by the person and filed
with the secretary of the corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the
member's name is placed on the proxy by the member or the member's attorney-infact,
whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile transmission, or
otherwise.
b. —intentionally left blank--
c. Subject Matter of Proxy to Be Stated
Any proxy covering matters for which a vote of the members is required shall not
be valid unless the proxy sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on
or, in an election of directors, the proxy lists the persons who have been nominated
at the time the notice of the vote is given to the members. Such matters include
amendments of the articles of incorporation or bylaws changing proxy rights;
certain other amendments of the articles of incorporation; removal of directors
without cause; filling vacancies on the board of directors; the sale, lease, exchange,
conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets,
unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation's
activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger
agreement; or the election to dissolve the corporation.
d. Revocability of Proxies
No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the
proxy, unless provided otherwise in the proxy, except that the maximum term of a proxy shall be three years after the date of execution. A validly executed proxy
shall continue in full force and effect until either
o (a) it is revoked by the member executing it, before the vote is cast under
that proxy (i) by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the
proxy is revoked, or (ii) by a subsequent proxy executed by that member
and presented to the meeting, or (iii) as to any meeting, by that member's
personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or
o (b) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of the proxy is
received by the corporation before the vote under that proxy is counted. A
proxy may not be irrevocable.
6.17. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings
Any members' meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time
to time by the vote of the majority of the members represented at the meeting, either in
person or by proxy. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. When a
members' meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means
of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen
communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting
at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice
or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the
record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned
meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting.
