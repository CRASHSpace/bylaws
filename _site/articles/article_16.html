    Article 16. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICY
16.1. Purpose
The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect this tax-exempt organization’s
(Organization) interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the
Organization or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is
intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing
conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.
16.2. Definitions
(a) Interested Person
Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with governing board
delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below,
is an interested person.
(b) A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through
business, investment, or family:
1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
Organization has a transaction or arrangement,
2. A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity or
individual with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement, or
3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement
with, any entity or individual with which the Organization is negotiating a
transaction or arrangement.
Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are
not insubstantial.
A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article III, Section 2, a
person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate
governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.
16.3. Procedures
(a) Duty to Disclose
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person
must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to
disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with
governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or
arrangement.
(b) Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest ExistsAfter disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any
discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or
committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and
voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict
of interest exists.
(c) Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest
1. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or
committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting
during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement
involving the possible conflict of interest.
2. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate,
appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the
proposed transaction or arrangement.
3. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall
determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more
advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not
give rise to a conflict of interest.
4. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible
under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or
committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors
whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Organization’s best interest, for
its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the
above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the
transaction or arrangement.
(d) Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a
member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall
inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an
opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
2. If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation
as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee
determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of
interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
16.4. Records of Proceedings
The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board delegated powers
shall contain:(a) The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a
financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the
nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of
interest was present, and the governing board’s or committee’s decision as to
whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
(b) The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating
to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any
alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes
taken in connection with the proceedings.
16.5. Compensation
(a) A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly
or indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from voting on
matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.
(b) A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation
matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the
Organization for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that
member’s compensation.
(c) No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction
includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
indirectly, from the Organization, either individually or collectively, is prohibited
from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.
16.6. Annual Statements
Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with governing board
delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:
(a) Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,
(b) Has read and understands the policy,
(c) Has agreed to comply with the policy, and
(d) Understands the Organization is charitable and in order to maintain its federal
tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more
of its tax-exempt purposes.
16.7. Periodic Reviews
To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and
does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following
subjects:
(a) Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on
competent survey information, and the result of arm’s length bargaining.
(b) Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management
organizations conform to the Organization’s written policies, are properly
recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further
charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or
in an excess benefit transaction.
16.8. Use of Outside Experts
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article 15, the Organization
may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not
relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are
conducted.
