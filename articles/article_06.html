<H3>6.1 Qualifications of Membership</H3>
<p>For purposes of Corporate Governance, this corporation shall have one class of members,
known as Voting Members.</p>
<p>Any person dedicated to the purposes of the corporation, having been proposed for
membership by three Voting members in good standing, shall be eligible for Voting
membership on approval of the membership application by the membership committee
and on timely payment of such dues and fees as the board may fix from time to time. The
procedure and policies for membership shall be determined by the board of directors. The
current membership policy is attached to these bylaws as Exhibit A.</p>

<p>All Voting members shall have the right to vote, as set forth in these bylaws, on the
election of the Board of Directors, on the disposition of all or substantially all of the

any committee members or board members by majority vote at a two week special
noticed meeting. In addition, members shall have all rights afforded members under the
California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.</p>

these bylaws, but no such reference shall constitute anyone as a member within the
meaning of Corporations Code section 5056 unless that person or entity shall have
qualified for a voting membership under Section 6.1 of these bylaws. References in these
bylaws to "members" shall mean members as defined in Corporations Code section 5056;
i.e., the members of the class set forth in Section 6.1 of these bylaws. By amendment of
its articles of incorporation or of these bylaws, the corporation may grant some or all of the rights of a member of any class to any person or entity that does not have the right to

<H3>6.13 Voting</H3>

<p>Subject to the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, all
members in good standing on the record date as determined under Section
6.15 of these bylaws shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of members.
Each member entitled to vote may cast one vote on each matter submitted to
a vote of the members. Members may not accumulate votes for the election
of directors.</p>

vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, a
consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the
meeting. The waiver of notice, consent, or approval need not specify either
the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting except that, if
action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any matter specified

shall state the general nature of the proposal. All such waivers, consents, or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. A member's attendance at a meeting shall also
constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting unless the
member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Also,
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the
consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting
but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.</p>

For purposes of establishing the members entitled to receive notice of any
meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting, or entitled to exercise any rights in
any lawful action, the board of directors may, in advance, fix a record date.

<H3>6.16 Proxies</H3>
<ul>
<li>a. Members' Proxy Rights<br>
Each member entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by
one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, signed by the person and filed
with the secretary of the corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the
member's name is placed on the proxy by the member or the member's attorney-infact,
whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile transmission, or
otherwise.</li>
<li>b. —intentionally left blank--</li>
<li>c. Subject Matter of Proxy to Be Stated<br>
Any proxy covering matters for which a vote of the members is required shall not
be valid unless the proxy sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on
or, in an election of directors, the proxy lists the persons who have been nominated
at the time the notice of the vote is given to the members. Such matters include
amendments of the articles of incorporation or bylaws changing proxy rights;
certain other amendments of the articles of incorporation; removal of directors
without cause; filling vacancies on the board of directors; the sale, lease, exchange,
conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets,
unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation's
activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger
agreement; or the election to dissolve the corporation.</li>
<li>d. Revocability of Proxies<br>
No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the
proxy, unless provided otherwise in the proxy, except that the maximum term of a
proxy shall be three years after the date of execution. A validly executed proxy
shall continue in full force and effect until either
<ul>
    <li>(a) it is revoked by the member executing it, before the vote is cast under
that proxy
    <ul>
        <li>(i) by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the
proxy is revoked, or</li>
        <li>(ii) by a subsequent proxy executed by that member
and presented to the meeting, or</li>
        <li>(iii) as to any meeting, by that member's
personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>(b) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of the proxy is
received by the corporation before the vote under that proxy is counted. A
proxy may not be irrevocable.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<H3>6.17 Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings</H3>
<p>Any members' meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time
to time by the vote of the majority of the members represented at the meeting, either in
person or by proxy. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. When a
members' meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the
adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means
of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen
communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting
at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice
or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the
record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned
meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting.</p>
